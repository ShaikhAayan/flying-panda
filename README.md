 Inspiration
We wanted to create a simple yet addictive game that combines the nostalgia of classic games like Flappy Bird and Dino Run but with a fresh twist. Flying Panda brings the charm of a flying panda, giving players an experience that's easy to jump into and challenging to master—all within a browser.

 What it does
Flying Panda is a browser-based game where players control a panda soaring through the skies, dodging obstacles, and collecting points. As the game progresses, the panda’s speed increases, making it harder to navigate through the gaps and avoid hazards.

 How we built it
We built Flying Panda using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on lightweight design for smooth performance on any browser. JavaScript handles the core game mechanics, including physics for jumping and collision detection. CSS brings visual style to the game, while HTML provides the framework for the interface and layout.

Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was managing smooth animations and accurate collision detection purely with JavaScript, especially as the speed increases. We also had to balance game performance with visual appeal to ensure smooth gameplay across devices.

 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a fully-functional game with responsive controls and charming visuals using only web technologies. The smooth gameplay and intuitive interface make it accessible and fun for players of all ages. Achieving this level of polish with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was a rewarding accomplishment.

What we learned
This project deepened our understanding of game development fundamentals in a browser environment. We learned how to implement physics and collision detection in JavaScript, optimize animations for better performance, and use CSS to create an appealing visual style.

What's next for Flying Panda
Next, we’d like to add features like leaderboards, additional levels with new environments, and power-ups for enhanced gameplay. We’re also considering porting the game to mobile for an even wider audience and adding multiplayer functionality for a fun, competitive twist.
